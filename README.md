# Item-Management-App

To create this web application, you will need to follow the steps below:

Set up the backend server using Spring Boot: You can create a new Spring Boot project using your preferred IDE or create one from scratch using the Spring Initializr. You will need to add the necessary dependencies for Spring Web, Spring Data JPA, and any other dependencies you need for your in-memory database or file-based storage system. Once you have set up your project, you can create a simple REST API to handle the CRUD operations for managing items.
Create the in-memory database or file-based storage system: You can use a simple in-memory database like H2 or a file-based storage system like SQLite to store the items. Alternatively, you can also use a simple data structure like a list or a map to store the items in memory.
Implement the Item model: You will need to create a simple Item model to represent the items in the system. The model should have two fields - name and description.
Implement the REST API: You will need to create REST endpoints for handling the CRUD operations for managing items. You can use the Spring Data JPA repository to handle the persistence of items in the in-memory database or file-based storage system.
Set up the frontend application using ReactJS: You can create a new ReactJS project using create-react-app or any other boilerplate you prefer. You will need to add the necessary dependencies for Axios or any other HTTP client library you prefer for communicating with the backend API.
Implement the UI components: You will need to create UI components for displaying the list of items, adding new items, and searching for items by name. You can use any CSS framework like Bootstrap or Material UI to style your components.
Integrate the frontend and backend applications: Finally, you will need to integrate the frontend and backend applications by making HTTP requests to the backend API from the frontend application. You can use Axios or any other HTTP client library to make these requests.
